# Mathematical-Wheel
This C program is a project called Math Wheel. In a nutshell, the program has these features: 
- in "ozdegerbul()" function, the user will give us an nxn matrix and we have to find the eigenvalue of this matrix.
- in "schur()" function, first the "ozdegerbul()" function will we run and then those returns will be sent to "schur()" functions as parameters. With these parameters, we will find limit values of every eigenvalue with the help of Schur Inequality.
-  in "nilpotent()" function, the function will check that if the user input matrix is a Nilpotent Matrix or not.
